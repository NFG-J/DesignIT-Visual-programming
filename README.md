# DesignIT-Visual-programming
This is a first minimum viable solution for drag and drop webdesign with HTML, mockup-data and CSS.For installment on your own laptop or mac.

Installation:
All files should be downloaded and installed as follows:
index2.html and excel_to_python2.py in root folder of your chosen IDE (I uses Webstorm, so, for me; WebstormProjects; DesignIT_2.03 (folder)
Subfolders (and content, files);
css (StudioStyle.css)
data (components.json, and WebComponents (version 2025-01-09).xlsx)
js (StudioScriptTwo.js)
Webstorm may create subfolder .idea and a folder exported for canvases that you export using the system

You can run test and use the system using e g Chrome.

Idea: 
I wanted to make a web-based studio for design of webpages, in HTML and JavaScript.
The design should translate to code for the webpage, in HTML
It should function like this, to the right is a menu with names of HTML elements, like, e.g., HTML form element, input element, etc.
By now, the menu is populated with 40 of the most used elements.
When the user drags a copy of an element from the menu into the workspace, canvas in the middle window, the same element is added as HTML code in a window to the left in the screen, tab 1 content. The corresponding CSS code is shown under tab 2 content. Tab 3 shows the reference, for most part to the Mozilla Developer site, soem to W3school. 
When you export the result, you can rightclick and shos the HTML code and use this for further design in your IDE of choice. CSS is collected under the <head> element. Beware that bugs or bad markup may occur. So the output of this application is thought as an input for further development and test work. You may also make your own data, for the menu, using the excel and the py file
Best of luck!
